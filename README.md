# Postedin Frontend Test

This is the test used by Postedin to technically evaluate the candidates for our Frontend vacancies. If you are participating in a selective process for our team, at some point you will receive this link, but if you got here "by chance", feel invited to develop our test and send a message to us in the e-mail jobs@postedin.com

## Instructions

You should create a fork of this project, and develop it on top of your fork. Use the main README of your repository to tell us how your test was solved, the decisions you made, how you organized and separated your code, and especially the instructions on how to run your project, after all the first person who will run your project will be a programmer of our team, and if you can explain him how to do this, you've started well!

Remember that this is a technical test and not a public tender, so there is not just one correct answer. Show that you are good and impress us, but do not forget the purpose of the project.

We do not set a time limit for solving this test, which is valid for us and the final result and evolution of the project creation until we achieve this result, but we believe that this challenge can be solved in about 8 hours of coding.

## The Challenge 

We need you to create a nice blog using our content. This blog should be called "The Marketing Blog" and should be used to share content in social media. 

We have [guidelines](GUIDELINES.md) that are going to be helpful to create your blog. Also, you have to answer this [questionnaire](QUESTIONNAIRE.md).

Remember to be consistent with our expectations, try to make us happy and to imppress us. Avoid doing things that we dislike and read carefully the list of things that we evaluate.

### What we expect

  * See a solution made in Ember. Use the framework in the best possible way (methodology /  structure). Choose the version of ecmascript you like. It is ok if you want to use another framework, but let us know.
  * Also see the use of dependency managers (npm, webpack, bower)
  * Automate tasks with gulp, grunt or other tool of your choice (ember will handle this for you if you use it)
  * HTML written in the most semantic way possible (HTML5 / 5.1)
  * CSS3 / 4 - With a pre-processor of CSS (the choice is at your discretion, but here we use SASS)
  * Mobile first and responsive layout

### What would makes us happy

  * Unit Tests
  * Some methodology for defining and organizing your CSS code

### What would impress us

  * BEM naming convention
  * Apply css animations when possible and watch out for the performance of your animation :)
  * View the code running live (Static Bucket S3, Heroku, Firebase Hosting)

### What we would not like

  * Find out that it was not you who did your test
  * See large commits without much explanation in the messages in your repository
  * Finding a commit with the NPM and Bower dependencies or sensitive data

## What we will evaluate from your test

  * History of git commits
  * Instructions on how to run the project
  * Organization, semantics, structure, readability, maintainability of your code
  * Scope of the proposed objectives
  * Mobile adaptation (responsive layout)
  * Components and extensibility of Javascript components
  * Answers from the questionnaire
